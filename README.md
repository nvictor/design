# Software Design Documents

This directory contains the design documents for various software projects. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific application and contains a `DESIGN.md` file that outlines its architecture, data models, and key features.

## Project Overview

The projects are organized in two forms:
1. **Full Projects**: Complete Xcode projects with organized file structures (in individual project folders)
2. **Single-File Prototypes**: Condensed single-file implementations (in the `1fa` folder)

Each project includes comprehensive design documentation that reflects the current implementation state, including architectural decisions, data models, user interface patterns, and technical implementation details.

## Applications

- **Clustermap**: Kubernetes treemap visualizer with authentication and resource metrics
- **Treemap**: Generic hierarchical data visualization using squarified treemap layouts
- **Grooves**: Musical step-sequencer with audio engine and MIDI export
- **Jiraiya**: Native macOS Companion to JIRA
- **Moves**: Musical phrase composer with segment-based arrangements
- **Parts**: Song structure arranger for musical compositions
- **Connect**: Node-and-connector diagram creator
- **Presence**: Group attendance status tracker
- **Vignette**: Stylized image generator for text content

All design documents are kept current with the actual implementations to ensure accuracy and usefulness for development and maintenance.
