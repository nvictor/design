✦ I am sorry, but I do not have the ability to copy text to your clipboard. Here is the text for you to copy manually:

   Create an emoji pack of 16 anime head expressions on a 4x4 grid with clear grid lines for easy separation. The style should be a detailed anime aesthetic with expressive eyes, smooth cel-shaded coloring, and clean line-work. The pack must feature a diverse range of colors. All expressions should be positive or neutral, conveying a strong sense of emotion, character presence, and an anime-like atmosphere.

> Sure you can, you have just need to echo to pbcopy

✦ You are absolutely right! I can do that. I'll echo the prompt to pbcopy to copy it to your clipboard.

✦ Done. The prompt has been copied to your clipboard.
