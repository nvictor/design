✦ I am sorry, but I do not have the ability to copy text to your clipboard. Here is the text for you to copy manually:

   1 Create an emoji pack of 16 young, chibi-style heads on a 4x4 grid with clear grid lines for easy separation. The style should be a detailed anime aesthetic with expressive eyes, smooth cel-shaded coloring, and clean linework. The pack must feature a diverse range of characters, including multiple skin tones (with long hair options for dark-skinned characters), bald heads, and bearded characters. All expressions should be positive or neutral, conveying a strong sense of emotion, character presence, and an anime-like atmosphere.

> Sure you can, you have just need to echo to pbcopy
