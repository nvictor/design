- Complete Cards & Active Review Habits

## 🔧 Areas for Improvement & Action Plan

### ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
1.  **Tagging System:** Implement hierarchical tags for all cards (e.g., `#gcp`, `#kubernetes`, `#vocabulary`, `#tech-facts`, `#difficulty`).
    *   **Action:** Immediately tag all 875 cards with main categories (2-3 hours).
2.  **Context Enhancement for Date Cards:** Add context to 29 short-answer date cards (e.g., founders, significance, related facts).
    *   **Action:** Enhance all 29 short-answer date cards (30-45 minutes).

### ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
3.  **Optimize List-Based Cards:** Convert ~20 high-value "name X..." list cards to cloze deletions for individual item testing.
    *   **Action:** Review and convert 20 high-value list cards to cloze format.
4.  **Address Leech Cards (42 cards):** Review and enhance frequently forgotten cards (e.g., add audio for pronunciation, simplify questions, add mnemonics/images).
    *   **Action:** Review all 42 leech cards, identify difficulties, and rewrite/enhance.

### ⭐ LOW PRIORITY
5.  **Add Visual Elements:** Incorporate images, diagrams, or visual aids for complex concepts (e.g., Kubernetes architecture, GCP hierarchies).
    *   **Action:** Start with 10-20 high-value cards, focusing on architecture and relationships.
6.  **Create Deck Hierarchy:** Organize the 12 flat decks into a logical hierarchical structure (e.g., `Tech Learning 2025/Cloud Computing/GCP Fundamentals`).
    *   **Action:** Create parent decks and move/rename existing decks descriptively.
7.  **Consider Reverse Cards:** Create reverse cards for key terminology and command-to-function relationships (e.g., "what word means 'implied'?").
    *   **Action:** Switch 20-30 high-value cards to "Basic (and reversed card)" note type or create separate cards.
